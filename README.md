# Internet Relay Chat
This project is about creating your own `IRC server`.

**Internet Relay Chat** or **IRC** is a text-based communication protocol on the Internet.
It offers real-time messaging that can be either public or private. Users can exchange
direct messages and join group channels

`IRC clients` connect to `IRC servers` in order to join channels. `IRC servers` are connected
together to form a network.
